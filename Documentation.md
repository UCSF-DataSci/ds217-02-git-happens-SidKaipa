Part 1.

I created files first.txt, second.txt, third.txt, and fourth.txt for first branch in the scaffold branch, used git add to add them, then comit them, and then finally push them to the main branch.

Part 2. 

I created a setup_project.sh code file that creates the necessary directories and files needed for parts 2 and 3. Futhermore, I also created a dummy student.csv file with made up students and grades so that the .py codes could have something to be tested on. I made the code executable and ran it using ./setup_project.sh so that the necessary directories and files were created.

Part 3. 

I created the python codes. Both codes contain comments that state what the function does and how it goes about doing that. I used git add to add all the files and the code, and pushed it up the branch. From there, I ran both codes and received outputs which are found in the output folder. I pushed all changes upstream and then pruned the branches.
